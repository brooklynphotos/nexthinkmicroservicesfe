# Nexthink Microservices Exercise: Front End
## Comments
Did not take a lot of time to work on this. My background is mostly backend and big data. However, I have worked with React a few years back for personal projects and so it did not take more than an hour to get back up to speed with how things are set up and general concepts of state management and asynchronous calls.
Total time on project: 2 hours 
## Improvements
* A better place to store the URL instead of hard coding
* A better way to show the result of the microservice instances, perhaps in some nice list or table
* Very fancy is to periodically check the health and then update a colorful indicator
* More rigorous testing and also unit testing
