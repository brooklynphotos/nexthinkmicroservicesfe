# Nexthink Microservices Exercise: Front End
## Comments
### Technical Challenge
I haven't done React in a few years and it was always for personal projects. So needed time to brush up again on basic concepts.
### Time Spent
Total time on the actual project: 2 hours 
### Changes to requirement
I did not include the feature to check the health. That would require one of the following:
1. Submitting a payload and checking the health. Did not make sense from a user's perspective.
2. Checking on an existing deployment. That is not a feature the server has so the UI can't do it without more work.
## Improvement Ideas
* Add a feature to list current deployments and check their health.
* A better place to store the URL instead of hard coding
* A better way to show the result of the microservice instances, perhaps in some nice list or table
* Very fancy is to periodically check the health and then update a colorful indicator
* More rigorous testing and also unit testing
